# app-meteorito
A web application that consumes [this API by NASA] (https://data.nasa.gov/view/ak9y-cwf9) which displays information about meteorite landings on Earth.

We also provide a link to the meteorite landing site on Google Maps if the coordinates are available.

This web application was done using [Bootstrap] (http://getbootstrap.com/), [jQuery] (https://jquery.com/) and [DataTables] (https://datatables.net/).
